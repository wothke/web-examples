This example implemetation is meant to ease use of my various ScriptNodePlayer 
based chiptune emulators.

	usage: 	copy this into some content folder of your webserver, then call 
			http://[insert path info here]/usePlaylist.html?playlistURL=./playlist.txt&shuffle=true

It might be useful to anyone trying to directly integrate the plain player/backend
libs into his own web pages. (With their bells and whistles my regular example pages 
may be a bit overwhelming as a respective starting point.)

It shows how the generic ScriptNodePlayer can be configured for use with a specific 
backend (in this case the one for XMP). 

The code below tries to keep it simple (all in one file, no extra libs, no 
fancy GUI, etc).

Functionality wise it only provides the basics: "play", "pause", "volume".
Due to popular demand it then shows one add-on feature, that is how a simple "playlist"
functionality ("next", "previous", "shuffle") might be integrated with the player (see 
separate PHP script in this folder for an example on how a respective playlist might 
be automatically generated).

There are certainly many improvements that could be made to this example implementation 
and I have left "exercise .." comment where it might be educational to the reader.

Advice: The one thing that might be most puzzling to beginners is the extensive use of 
"callbacks" - whenever file operations are involved: You may be used to traditional PC 
programming, where IO can be done synchronously (e.g. "load(filename)" returns when the
file has been loaded). Within a web application such a "blocking wait" is a no-go, that's 
why some "load(filename)" just takes the order but then directly returns even before 
the data has been loaded. The concept is that you supply an additional "callback" function, e.g. 
"load(filename, myCallbackFunc)" and eventough the "load" returns directly without 
any data, you will know when the data is ready because the respective background loader 
will then invoke your "myCallbackFunc". It helps if you get comfortable with that approach.
