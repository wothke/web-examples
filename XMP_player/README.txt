Two examples with regards to my various music players:

usage: 	copy this folder into some content folder of your webserver (see below files 
		for more information)

example 1: usePlaylist.html 
		
		simple page illustrating how to setup an XMP player with playlist functionality
		(the implementation can be used as a blueprint for the use of any of my other
		emulator backends, e.g. C64, Atari, Spectrum, Playstation, Arcade, etc)
		
		
example 2: genPlaylist.php 
		
		a PHP script that automatically generates a playlist based on the files that 
		it finds within a specific directory tree (can be used with usePlaylist.html )
